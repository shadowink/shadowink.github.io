Getting AWX to work with AD nested groups.

This one was a nightmare.  I am a Linux guy.  I don't speak AD.  I can fumble through some LDAP commands but I typically don't know what I'm doing.

I set up AWX, the open source version of Ansible Tower for our team.  It works well.  For authentication my company uses Active Directory.  The IT security team said we needed to have access to AWX restricted to members of a specific Group in our AD.  That makes sense.  Our AWX playbooks can do some powerful stuff.

Of course, getting all that to work was a trial.
